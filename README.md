# Temperature-Distribution-FDM
This repository contains the implementation of temperature dirstribution in a straight fin problem in MATLAB.
Finite Difference Method (FDM) was used to determine the temperature distribution at the grid point.

## Parameters
- Length of the Fin = $4cm$
- Perimeter of the Fin = $40.4cm$
- Cross-section Area $A_c=cm^2$
